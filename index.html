        <p>A rhino calf is born after a gestation period of roughly 475 days, or about 16 months. However, the mother
            may be pregnant with her calf for as long as 18 months. Only one calf is born per pregnancy, and arrives in
            the world covered in red-brown hair. This hair protects the calf from the elements, keeping it warm at night
            and preventing sunburn during the day.</p>
